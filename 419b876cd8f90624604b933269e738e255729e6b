annoyingly, clap includes an empty 'Usage:' section when the usage
feature is disabled, rather than just omitting it. not wanting an empty
section is the only reason i have enabled it, as the generated output
of "name [OPTIONS]" is completely pointless. why it does not just list
the actual options there, so that it would actually convey useful
information, is beyond me.
